I"·<p>The High Screen is a Sports and Entertainment blog that was active from 2014-2015. Weâ€™ve covered stories from the informative to the irreverent, seeking to engage readers while entertaining them at the same time. Formed by former <a href="https://www.oswegonian.com/">Oswegonian</a> staffers and SUNY Oswego alumni Joe Mags, Moraima CapellÃ¡n Pichardo, and Dan Truong, The High Screen was an experiment to continue the high-energy thrills that was gained when writing for The Oswegonian. This site serves as an archive of the stories that were written by many of our high-talented journalists and writers.</p>
