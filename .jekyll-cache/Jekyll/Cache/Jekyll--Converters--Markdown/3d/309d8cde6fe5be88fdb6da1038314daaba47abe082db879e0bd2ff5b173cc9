  <li>Anaheim (4) – The Ducks should cruise to a top seed if they can avoid being beaten to death by John Scott.</li>
  <li>Los Angeles (1) – Stumbled out of the gate a tad but nothing a six-game win streak couldn’t fix.</li>
  <li>Montreal (12) – And that’s how you take advantage of a slow Boston start.</li>
  <li>Minnesota (11) – What did the Avalanche do to deserve those complete and utter ass-kickings?</li>
  <li>Washington (19) – A little Barry Trotz goes a long way.</li>
  <li>New York Islanders (15) – An excellent start despite putrid goaltending.</li>
  <li>Nashville (23) – Somehow I feel they won’t hold onto the Central lead for long. Still a nice start, though.</li>
  <li>Tampa Bay (9) – No surprises here. Everyone looks about as good as they should.</li>
  <li>Chicago (2) – If Crawford’s playing this well throughout, they’re unstoppable.</li>
  <li>Dallas (8) – Seguin’s an absolute monster but they need to defend better</li>
  <li>New Jersey (14) – They look solid despite a mediocre start for Schneider.</li>
  <li>Detroit (18) – Zetterberg with 10 points in eight games, he’s back.</li>
  <li>Calgary (29) – They once again steadfastly refuse to draft in the top three.</li>
  <li>Ottawa (20) – Anderson and Lehner playing like ’91 Belfour/Hasek tandem.</li>
  <li>Boston (3) – No Chara, no Boychuk. Can I interest you in a Tyler Myers contract?</li>
  <li>Pittsburgh (7) – They’ll be fine, but my God Craig Adams is terrible.</li>
  <li>San Jose  (6) – The seven-game losing streak to Buffalo is unbelievably strange.</li>
  <li>Vancouver (21) – Still don’t understand why they signed Miller.</li>
  <li>Columbus (13) – Ryan Johansen doesn’t look too rusty.</li>
  <li>Philadelphia (17) – I just can’t believe the Steve Mason/Ray Emery platoon looks bad.</li>
  <li>New York Rangers (10) – Rick Nash is getting all that positive regression out of the way before the playoffs start.</li>
  <li>St. Louis (5) – T.J. Oshie and Steve Ott with a matching one point, no goals through seven games.</li>
  <li>Arizona (24) – Try rebranding yourselves as a team that doesn’t play in a desert of apathy.</li>
  <li>Florida (26) – Dangerously close to being outscored by Corey Perry.</li>
  <li>Edmonton (22) – They’re playing less terrible of late.</li>
  <li>Toronto (25) – Shanahan, Dubas, Extra Skater and co. have their work cut out for them.</li>
  <li>Colorado (16) – They can’t be this bad all year, right?</li>
  <li>Winnipeg (27) – It take eight games for them to fall into last place. Smart money is on them not climbing out.</li>
  <li>Buffalo (30) – One goal in four games and they aren’t even last overall.</li>
  <li>Carolina (28) – Every team in the NHL has multiple wins, except for the winless ‘Canes.</li>
