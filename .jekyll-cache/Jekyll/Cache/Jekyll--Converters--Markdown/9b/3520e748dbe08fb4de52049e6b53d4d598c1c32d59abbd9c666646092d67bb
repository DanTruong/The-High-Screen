I"2<p>Maybe one day we’ll get a good Thursday night football game. But probably not. If the NFL hasn’t learned its lesson about short-week football, it never will. Seven of last year’s 17 match ups were decided by double digits. Following the Giants’ decimation of Washington on national television, <strong>every single Thursday Night contest in the 2014 season has been decided by a differential of at least 20 points</strong>. Let that sink in. But no, let’s keep pushing for more “premium” games, and longer seasons. Please. Onto the weekend.</p>
