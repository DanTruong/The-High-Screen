I"…<p>Itâ€™s a match up weâ€™ve seen plenty of times before under circumstances that feel oddly familiar. The Jets are busy bottom-feeding and the Patriots are surging. And yet through it all, you canâ€™t help but feel the Jets have some semblance of a chance tonight. Look, thereâ€™s no question as to who has the more talented team and itâ€™s not close. Not even Rex Ryan-Mark Sanchez-Mrs. Ryan close. That said, the two annual match ups against the Patriots have kind of become the Jetsâ€™ versionÂ of the Super Bowl. Iâ€™d go as far as to sayÂ that tonightâ€™s game is more competitive than the real Super Bowl that unfolded last February.</p>
