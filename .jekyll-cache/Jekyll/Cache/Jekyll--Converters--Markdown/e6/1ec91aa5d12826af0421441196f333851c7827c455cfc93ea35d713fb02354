<p>Itâ€™s not very often a person can find something they can call their â€œthing.â€ Iâ€™m sure when LeBron James dunked for the first time, at the age of 6 (Okay, okayâ€¦ <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/5266/the-first-time-lebron-dunked-a-basketball">he was in 8th grade</a>), he knew basketball was his thing. For me, Iâ€™m not sure when it happened exactly, but something incredibly special became my thing: Christmas.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t an exaggeration; Iâ€™ve truly become a â€œChristmas person.â€ Come November, Iâ€™m not thinking about Thanksgiving â€” Iâ€™m thinking about Christmas Eve <em>Eve,</em> a.k.a. Thanksgiving. My ringtone right now is â€œLast Christmasâ€ by WHAM!</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t a joke folks; Iâ€™m all about the season.</p>

<p>With all that said, I have no idea why Christmas is so special to me. You might be thinking to yourself, thatâ€™s not possible, but I really canâ€™t find the connection between my childhood love of the holiday and my current genuine appreciation. When weâ€™re kids Christmas is simple: itâ€™s about getting the things you want most and spending time with the people you love. Simply put, itâ€™s the two things a child craves most in the world. Like other kids, I was simply gaga about Christmas: the lore, the bright lights and that jolly fat man. Itâ€™d be easy to say this is when I fell in love with Christmas but is there a kid in this world (religious denominations aside) who doesnâ€™t appreciate Christmas?</p>

<p>The commercialism side to Christmas, which is used as a shield for all the scrooges out there around the holiday season, is still an intricate part of Christmas. Iâ€™ve always been keen to entertainment and toy companies licking their chops at the thought of holiday season, but isnâ€™t giving someone special something special the point of Christmas?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s for this reason exactly Iâ€™ll be doing a movie challenge this month. I donâ€™t think my definition of Christmas is really as clear as it ought to be. Iâ€™ll admit, I take the easy way out in my description and use phrases like â€œa time for loveâ€ and â€œthe time of year you appreciate what you have,â€ but honestly that all applies to Thanksgiving, Easter, Earth Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>

<p>I plan to get to the bottom of Christmas, but Iâ€™m going to do it in a few different ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cheerful-Aged-Santa-Posing.jpg"><img src="/img/Cheerful-Aged-Santa-Posing.jpg" alt="Cheerful Aged Santa Posing With A Clapperboard" /></a></p>

<p><strong>My ChildhoodÂ </strong></p>

<p>There are movies that Iâ€™ll never be able to disassociate with my childhood and Christmas. Some of these are classics, like the <em>Home Alone</em> series, <em>A Christmas Story</em> and <em>A Christmas Carol,</em> and others are a little more unconventional like <em>A Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, <em>Jingle All the Way</em> and <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone</em>. This is already a motley collection and itâ€™s not even official yet. It could be the fact that I was mostly raised by a single mother but movies have been a constant influence in my life and, to be frank, there was just more down time around Christmas so I know I got to watch a lot more specifically themed movies.</p>

<p><strong>The United States</strong></p>

<p>This could just be some ethnocentrism, which I hope it isnâ€™t, but I just feel like us Yankees love us some Christmas. I could think this because like others in this country, T.V., film and popular culture have only shown me things from a red, white and blue perspective. But on the other side of things, I grew up a Haitian-American, so eggnog and holly were never a part of my Christmas starter kit â€” actually, I couldnâ€™t think of a Haitian Christmas starter kit if I tried. This is where movies like <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> (which I think is about Santaâ€¦?) will come into play. For all the love I bare Christmas and Holiday flicks, Iâ€™m severely lacking in many of the classics; I only know who Heat Miser is because of commercials and Iâ€™ve never even seen <em>Itâ€™s a Wonderful Life</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The World</strong></p>

<p>And finally, itâ€™s been hard to remember, Christmas is a global holiday. I pride myself on watching the films that are nominated for best foreign film at the academy awards but Iâ€™ve never seen a foreign Christmas movie. I couldnâ€™t name one if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLZj3zOUZNs">triple dog dared me</a>. The rest of the world has to have an opinion on Christmas, whether they celebrate it or not, and Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ve got things to say about the American Christmas. Something tells me things will be a little different, but at the same time, how far can you deviate from such a mass-produced holiday?</p>

<p>With this challenge ahead of me Iâ€™m sure to learn a great deal. Iâ€™ll be watching a couple of films each week to make these posts just bursting with holiday cheer. See you at the end and have a happy holidays.</p>
