I"D<p>Another 2-4 week against the spread. Alas. It thought it would be 3-3 after Alabama was up 27-0 against Tennessee, but the Crimson Tide took the foot off the pedal and only won by two touchdowns. I feel pretty good about picking Syracuse to cover against Clemson, but I feel just as bad for picking Washington State.</p>
