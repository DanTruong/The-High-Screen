I"†<p>First off, apologies. Iâ€™ve been absent for two weeks adjusting to a new schedule that features a lot of hockey broadcasts and a fair amount of travel. Now settled in on a nice long home-stand, itâ€™s time to get back to football. I should mention that I have indeed still been making picks for each game and that my record now sits at 83-51, good for a winning percentage of .619.</p>
