I"<p>Andrew Luck and Nick Foles are no strangers. The two did battle over the course of the transformation of the Pac-10 into the Pac-12 from the years 2009-2011. Luck emerged the victor, taking the final two of the pairâ€™s three meetings, out-slinging Foles 1047 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception to 902 yards, five touchdowns and likewise, one interception. Tonight marks the first time the Pac alum do battle in the NFL, and much as it was in college, their play will dictate their teamsâ€™ respective fates.</p>
