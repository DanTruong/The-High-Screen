I"ş<p>The recently-developed one-game wild card playoff in baseball has created a â€œdo or dieâ€ or â€œone and doneâ€ mentality. After 162 games, suddenly, only one game matters. Never has this been more appropriate than for this yearâ€™s American League matchup. Kansas City and Oakland are entrenched in win now seasonsÂ more so than the rest of the playoff field. For most fan bases, sans New York Yankees, itâ€™s never really World Series or bust, but these two teams are as close as it gets this year.</p>
