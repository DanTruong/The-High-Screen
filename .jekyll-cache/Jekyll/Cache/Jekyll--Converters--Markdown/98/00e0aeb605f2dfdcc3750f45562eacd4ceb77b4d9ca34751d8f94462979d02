<p>The comedy band, <em>Garfunkel and Oates</em>, go from computer screen to TV screen with the premiere of their self-titled show on IFC. Prior to the official August 7 premiere, the pilot was up and running online (<a href="http://bcove.me/9mpfxu9n">watch it here</a>) which is more than appropriate for this YouTube famous duo. So far, some of their popular YouTube songs like â€œGo Sports Goâ€ and â€œThe Fade Awayâ€ have made it onto the show.</p>

<p>Although Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci play fictionalized versions of themselves, itâ€™s clear that theyâ€™re inspired by their personal lives and other modern topics. They shed some light on real issues that were previously undefinable. (There is, in fact, a polite way to call someone a basic bitch â€” a <a href="http://www.albashow.com/entertainment-shqip-garfunkel-and-oates-talk-new-ifc-show-beige-curtains-and-not-smoking-weed-with-their-fans/">â€œbeige curtainâ€</a> aka someone whoâ€™s not good, not bad, just there; it doesnâ€™t get more basic than that.)</p>

<p>The ladies have also done us the courtesy ofÂ addressing a rather awkward and unspoken situation. For those of you who are decent human beings, a fade away is basically when you ignore someone out of existence by lying until they get the hint and go away forever. Pulling a fade away and being the faded away from are equally brutal. But this brutal truth bomb was sugarcoated with lighthearted song and dance number.</p>

<p>Aside from entertaining us with socially awkward scenarios, itâ€™s nice to see these ladies use their comedy to shed some light on a few womenâ€™s issues. While itâ€™s hilarious to watch them go through relationships without literally speaking a word, itâ€™s strange to think that some women believe they have to conceal parts, especially the ugly parts, in order to make things work.</p>

<p>Lindhome and Micucci also get by with a little help from a few famous friends and fellow comedians. Anthony Jesselnik, Natasha Leggero, Steve Agee, Malcolm Barrett and Sir Ben Kingsley all appear in the first episode. Itâ€™s easy to see why they incorporated Hall and Oates into their name â€” John Oates himself is supposed to make an appearance in episode two next week.</p>

<p>Real talk aside, <em>Garfunkel and Oates</em> is full of quirky nonsensical antics. It doesnâ€™t get much weirder or unrealistic than breaking out into song mid-felatio about said ordeal. Thereâ€™s also plenty of subtle and unspoken humor. Sure, breaking out into an 80s aerobics music video is strange enough on its own, but itâ€™s especially weird when it happens as the girls fix themselves a meal consisting of graham crackers, frosting, and ice water.</p>

<p>So far <em>Garfunkel and Oates</em>Â is upbeat and fun-filled. Their songs are original to say the least, but the show has familiar elements that are so been-there, done-that. Viewers are no stranger to a pair of girls just trying to make it in the big city. The concept of a comedy folk band duo isnâ€™t foreign thanks to the short lived <em>Flight of the Conchords</em>. Luckily, this funny folk rock pair seem like theyâ€™ve got enough creative juices to find their own identity. As long as those voices remain in sweet harmony packed with punchy lyrics at the tip of their tongues.</p>
