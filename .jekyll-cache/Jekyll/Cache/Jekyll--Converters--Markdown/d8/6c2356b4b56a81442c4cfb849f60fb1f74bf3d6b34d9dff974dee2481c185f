I"Þ<p>A stunning start for Sacramento, spear-headed by the <a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/11/demarcus-cousins-boogie-wonderland/">dark horse MVP candidacy of DeMarcus Cousins</a>, had us believing the Kings wereÂ one of a dozen Western Conference teams contending for eight playoff spots. One case of viral meningitis and an ill-advised firing later â€” oh, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11865367/how-denver-nuggets-became-nba-biggest-disappointment">and whatever happened to Denver</a> â€” and the West is, more or less, a 10-team race for eight slots.</p>

<p>The injury riddled Oklahoma City Thunder are a .500 basketball team after the unlikeliest slew of injuries this side of Chicago; they share ninth-place with New Orleans, either the oldest-youngest or youngest-oldest team ever assembled, and possibly the worst team in league historyÂ builtÂ around an All-Star averaging 24 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks per game.</p>

San Antonio is closer to missing the playoffs than securing one of the top two seeds for the fifth consecutive season, while Golden State has elevated itself from a No. 6 seed to mostly unbeatable.</p>

<p>This is why Iâ€™ve decided to pull out my figurative camera over the next couple months of this devilishly fun season to take some snapshots of the West. Letâ€™s start at the bottom â€” thereâ€™s a Drake reference to be made â€” and work our way to the top.</p>
