I"u<p>Last weekend wasnâ€™t supposed to happen. The new college football playoff was supposed to trivialize regular season games. Instead, there were five upsets of teams ranked in the top eight, and the outlook for the rest of the season changed drastically. The Pac-12 came close to eliminating itself from playoff contention, while two Mississippi teams decided they would be relevant together and shake up the entire SEC race. The Big 10, once thought to be left for dead, is now (barely) alive again. The top of the Big 12 is good enough that a one-loss conference champion still has a great chance of making the playoffs.</p>
