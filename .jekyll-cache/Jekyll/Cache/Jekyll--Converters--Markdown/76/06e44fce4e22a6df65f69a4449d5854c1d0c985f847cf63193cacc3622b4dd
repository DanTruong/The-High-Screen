I"`<p>When I last wrote a “Dishonor for Connor” <a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/11/dishonor-connor-non-ranking-edition/">power rankings</a> about six weeks ago, the landscape for 30th place looked quite different than it does today. The Sabres had a firm grip on last place and some of the other bad teams were beginning to play well.</p>
