I"è<p>Fans usually look for the upcoming season to live up to higher standards than the previousÂ one, and the â€˜14-â€˜15 NBA campaign is expected to exceed lastÂ seasonâ€™s level of excitement in many ways. For some fans, excitement is seeing the same team make the Finals over and over again. Others are captivatedÂ byÂ a brand new team arrivingÂ as a contender after a long, devastating period of losing games. And some fans could care less, as long as they have a comfortable couch, something to snack on, and NBA League Pass. (What did we do before League Pass? It is so awesome to flip to the last minute of any game of your choice and see an exciting finish of any sort.Â The true NBA fans should be able to vouch for me on that one.)</p>
