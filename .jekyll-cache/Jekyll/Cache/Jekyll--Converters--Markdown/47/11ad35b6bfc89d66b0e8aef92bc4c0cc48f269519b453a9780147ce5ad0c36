I"Ž<p>Welcome to my power rankings on behalf of myself, Joe Mags andÂ The High Screen team. The Spurs claimed revenge in dominant fashion last year, the way they bashed Miami in the finals. However, think back toÂ when Vince Carter madeÂ that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjBzZpkuy38">fallbackÂ corner three to give Dallas a 2-1 lead</a> in the 2014 first round series. I get a kick out of Gregg Popovich at 19 seconds in the video. He walks off the court in disgust about two months prior to comfortably winning the 2014 NBA title. Mavs owner Mark Cuban also has a notable scene at 35 seconds where he does an entertaining celebration act.</p>
