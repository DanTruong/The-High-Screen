<p>Basketball and hip-hop have long been intertwined culturally. And so it is with great irony I suggest Drake won the Raptors the Atlantic Division last season.</p>

<p>In the springÂ of 2013, the anticipation forÂ <em>Yeezus</em> was unhealthy. I was on a college campus at the time, and as I was just saying to a buddy of mine the other day, the memories of Kanyeâ€™s four-year global takeoverÂ â€”Â <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>,Â <em>Watch the Throne</em>,Â <em>Cruel Summer</em>,Â and _Yeezus_back-to-back-to-back-to-backÂ â€” are inseparable from the whole of my college experience. Iâ€™ll never forget my Communications 100 lecture on the Wednesday afterÂ _MBDTFÂ _was released; the dinner break working atÂ the student-run newspaper where a co-editor pressed play on â€œCliqueâ€; hearing the shrill, animalistic opening to â€œMercyâ€ everywhere that I went for months on end.</p>

<p>I could go on and on and onâ€¦</p>

<p>I say all this because right around the peak ofÂ <em>YeezusÂ _build-up mania, Drake put out the first single from his new album, the insistent â€œStarted from the Bottom.â€ What can only be described as a polarizing single â€” Iâ€™m not a huge fan; that is completely independent from my admiration for the pride of Canada â€” â€œStarted from the Bottomâ€ took the empty space in betweenÂ _Cruel Summer</em> and the summer of 2013â€™s start-studded lineupÂ of expected LPs (<em>Yeezus</em>,Â <em>Magna Cartaâ€¦, The 20-20 Experience</em>, etc.) and stuffed itself inside of it.</p>

<p>Similar to when â€œMercyâ€ dropped, I could not go to a single bar, party or venueÂ without hearing Drake explain how often he argued with his Mother and how Drake dresses when nobody is paying attention. The difference? I still listen to â€œMercyâ€ frequently; and â€œStarted from the Bottomâ€ is unquestionably the most irritating song offÂ <em>Nothing Was The Same</em>. But like so many other annoyances of American culture, it persisted. There it was â€” at the rec center when I was playing basketball; blaring off some guyâ€™s headphones on the city bus; and in my class room, when my English professor would joke about hearing it on her way to work driving up from Syracuse.</p>

<p>The momentum of â€œStarted from the Bottomâ€ (and, to a lesser extent, <a href="http://vimeo.com/63116931">â€œ5 a.m. in Toronto,â€</a>Â to my chagrin, because itâ€™s 100x better) lasted all the way until August. Then this fascinating, pop contraption dropped.</p>

<p>By the timeÂ Nothing <em>Was The Same</em>Â was released in September â€” alongside perhaps the best song off the album, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WozERhq0_gk">â€œFurthest Thing,â€</a>Â whichÂ brilliantly captures the changing of the seasons: summer to fall;Â <em>Yeezus</em>Â (and the others) to Drake â€” the prophecy was written out. Kanye wouldnâ€™t <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201408/kanye-west?currentPage=1">mass publish it until July</a>, but Drake won the summer of 2013, and the year 2013 â€” Drizzy is on top.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>What does that have to do with Kyle Lowry, Demar DeRozan and the Toronto Raptors? First of all: WhatÂ <em>doesnâ€™t</em> that have to do with the Raptors? The franchiseâ€™s best moment before Drakeâ€™s rise to cultural prominence was, what, Vince Carterâ€™s dunk in the Olympics?</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEm78d8lrLk</p>

<p>Well, thatâ€™s actually a pretty great moment. Still,Â Toronto has been a lackluster franchiseÂ since its inception in the mid-90s; before this pastÂ season, TorontoÂ had secured onlyÂ one division title in its history. But Drake was a busy man in Sept. 2013. Weeks after releasing his new album, the Raptors announced him as their (wait for itâ€¦) Global Ambassador (!). Creating a position for the sake of adding popular musicâ€™s most unlikely megastar to your executive staff?? GENIUS!</p>

<p>Coupling the addition of General Manager/Quentin Tarantino movie character-level negotiator Masai Ujiri to the franchise with bringing Drake on board was like if Vince Carter dunked over a 7-footer in the Olympicsâ€¦ and then played above-average defense within his teamâ€™s scheme for a full season! The Raptors had become relevant to the average young person AND exceptionally smarter about basketball operations in a matter of months!</p>

<p>All of these positive vibes led to a series of moves, namely the unloadingÂ of Andrea Bargnani and Rudy Gay, which revealed the Raptors as one of the deepest, smartest young rosters in basketball. Dealing two of basketballâ€™s most ridiculous shot-takers wasÂ the equivalent of snow blowing away 25 pounds of dust and finding a pot of gold in the basement!! Attaboy, Ujiri!</p>

<p>While Masai Ujiri assembled much of this fantastic Raptors teams, Drake has been irreplaceable as a promotor for the organization. Toronto doesnâ€™t have a LeBron James or Kevin Durant, players who carry mobs of fans and receive attention wherever they go. (Outside of basketball circles, Amir Johnson and Terrence RossÂ are only so interesting.) But thatâ€™s Drakeâ€™s job! And heâ€™s really out there hyping up these guys!</p>

<p>The Raptors wereÂ no. 2 in offensive efficiency in the East last season after trading Gay on December 9, scoring 107.2 points per 100 possessions over 63 games. While its 41-22 record without Gay (4th-best in NBA) was a surprise, in basketball terms, it made a lot of sense. The Raptors had a true-shooting percentage of 55.2 without Gay, a Top 10 mark. That came up 3.2 percent (52.0) from the opening 19 games of the season, the same sized gap between the Dallas Mavericks (56.4 percent, really good) and the Sacramento Kings (53.2 percent, not very good at all, also Gayâ€™s new team).</p>

<p>The basketball all too often would stick in Torontoâ€™s offense with Gay, as the team was dead last in assist percentage (49.1) during the first 19 games of the season, per NBA.com. That number shot up to 60.6 percent over Torontoâ€™s final 63 games, the eight-highest mark in the Association. The 11.5 percentage point gap between those two figures? Roughly the difference between San Antonioâ€™s assist percentage (62.1) and, again, Sacramentoâ€™s (51.1 percent).</p>

<p>With Lowry in charge of the offense, Toronto whizzed passes around a deep rotation of multi-positional threats. Its most used lineup â€” Lowry/DeRozan/Ross/Amir Johnson/Jonas Valanciunas â€” played 708 minutes and posted a 64.4 assist percentage and 56.2 true-shooting percentage, both of which are easily Top 5 rates. Stick Patrick Patterson in for Amir Johnson, and over 128 minutes that unit scored 118.7 points per 100 possessions on a 58.8 true-shooting percentage. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRLSQDCkcaA">Those numbers just stand for Do-Right-And-Kill-Everything, right?</a>)</p>

<p>Even after one season, and a disappointing first-round exit to a veteran-led Brooklyn team, basketball fans understand what Toronto is up too. Surrounding Lowry, one of basketballâ€™s toughest and sure-handed lead guards, with a collection of shooters, scorers and bull dog forwards is a recipe for success â€” offensively and defensively, where the team was a Top 10 unit all season.</p>

<p>The biggest secret on this team, however, is a player that Toronto brought back for a measly <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/raptors/2014/07/09/greivis-vasquez-contract-toronto-free-agent-kyle-lowry/12441511/">2-year, $13 million contract extension</a> this off-season. Greivis Vasquez, to date, is mostly considered a backup NBA guard who benefited in New Orleans from bloated minutes â€” to the tune of 9.0 assists per game in 2012-13. But Vasquez, all 6-foot-6, 200 pounds of him, was part of a deadly secondary lineup in Toronto â€” one that figures to play an even larger role in 2014-15.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a fact (according to NBA.com): Following the Rudy Gay trade, the Raptors posted an offensive efficiency of 106.7 and a defensive efficiency of 98.2, thus a net efficiency rating of 8.5 points per 100 possessions, whenever Vasquez took the floor.</p>

<p>To quote Drake: Just let that shit sink inâ€¦</p>

<p>http://youtu.be/Wo1P_OKRtcQ?t=2m17s</p>

<p>Letâ€™s turn that up another notch. <a href="http://stats.nba.com/teamLineups.html?TeamID=1610612761&amp;pageNo=1&amp;rowsPerPage=25&amp;columnOrder=&amp;MeasureType=Advanced&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;filters=MIN*E*490&amp;DateFrom=12%2F09%2F2013&amp;GroupQuantity=2&amp;sortField=OFF_RATING&amp;sortOrder=DES">Vasquez and Lowry shared the backcourtÂ for 480 minutes</a> after the Rudy Gay trade, and in those minutes, Toronto had an offensive efficiency of 111.1 while limiting opponents to 96.2 points per 100 possessions. Thatâ€™s unreal. The Raptors were playing Joakim Noah/Chicago Bulls defense and scoring like the Dirk Nowitzki/Dallas Mavericks whenever they shared the court. Â These lineups would play a bit faster than Torontoâ€™s starters (96.4 possessions/48 minutes) and rebounded the basketball at an absurd rate: 55.3 percent, which would blow out any team in basketball.</p>

<p>Now Vasquez isnâ€™t single handily responsible for these mutant figures. Similar to the Nick Collison argument in Oklahoma City, which suggests the Thunder are at their best whenever he is on the floor, numbers only tell part of the story. But with that said, Vasquezâ€™s unique combination of height and vision allow Lowry to play off the ball without having to guard opposing 2-guards. The quartet of Lowry/Vasquez/DeRozan/Johnson was murderous last season in fairly limited time, but with a full off-season to look back on the numbers, I would be absolutely shocked if Vasquez isnâ€™t used like a sixth-man this season.</p>

<p><a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/do-the-raptors-have-too-much-depth/">Toronto goes 11 deep now</a>Â with Lou Williams on board, James Johnson as a lengthy wing defender off the bench and Patterson, Psycho T and Chuck Hayes holding down an underrated total front court. The Raptors may be devoid of a superstar talentÂ _onÂ _the court, but the teamâ€™s superstar executives have placed a superb collection of pieces together for the upcoming season. While New York and Brooklyn struggle to find their identity, and/or overpay their personnel in an attempt to procure one, and Boston and Philadelphia float around no-manâ€™s land, the best team in the Atlantic is in great position for its greatest season in franchise history.</p>

<p>And they are on their WORSTÂ behavior.</p>
