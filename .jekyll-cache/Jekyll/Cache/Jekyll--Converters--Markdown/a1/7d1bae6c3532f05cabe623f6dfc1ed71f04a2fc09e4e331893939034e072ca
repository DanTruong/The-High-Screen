Iâ€™m sitting at my desk in one of those uncomfortable dorm chairs in my room fit for a convict, decorated for a mental patient, confidently typing away at my laptop. On the heels of my successful first year, I recently accepted an editor position for the campus newspaper; Iâ€™m bangingÂ outÂ a piece on St. Bonaventureâ€™s womenâ€™s lacrosse team.</p>
