I"¥<p>LeBron James spurned his hometown fans in 2010 and went on his way to South Beach. Â But apparently Miami was just a temporary stop for James to collect a couple rings.</p>

<p>Four years later, he stunned Pat Riley and the Heat organization by making a confident return to Cleveland. Â But Dwyane Wade could sense Jamesâ€™ urge to return home after Miamiâ€™s lopsided loss in the 2014 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>â€œYou can tell where someoneâ€™s heart is and what theyâ€™re thinking,â€ said D-Wade on LeBronâ€™s decision to return to Cleveland. Â â€Me as his friend, I just support him. Â As crazy as that might sound, Iâ€™m supportive of my friends and doing what makes them happy.â€</p>

<p>Wade and James have openly discussed their unbreakable friendship and James fleeing Miami will not change that. Â The two are sure to remain close friends off the court. Â However, they will be bigger enemies than ever before when they step on the court.</p>

<p>It would be a false statement to say Riley and Micky Arison were unaffected by this dramatic loss. Â The team just lost one of the greatest players in the history of the game. Â However,Â Riley and Arison remain optimistic about Miamiâ€™s future and have every right to feel that way.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve proven that we can do it and weâ€™ll do it again,â€ Riley said of Miamiâ€™s current situation.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t see any reason to doubt him. Â As a player, coach, and president, Riley has been one of the NBAâ€™sÂ ultimate winners. Â He is a five-time champion as a coach and a two-time champion as an executive. Â Riley was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and has also been named one of the top ten coaches in NBA history.</p>

<p>Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh have decided to stay in town andÂ the HeatÂ have locked up some appealing players going forward. Â Two-time All-Star Luol Deng flipped places with James as he left Cleveland in free agency to go to South Beach.</p>

<p>Of course, Luol Deng will not fill in the shoes of LeBron James. Â But heâ€™s a hard worker - a forward of great size and defensive ability who averages 16 points and over six reboundsÂ for his career.Â  Deng is kind of LeBron-light; assuming Bosh takes over the leading scoring duties, Deng can be a jack-of-all trades for Miami.</p>

<p>Mario Chalmers, Chris Andersen, and Udonis Haslem have all re-signed as important role players. Â â€Super Marioâ€ has been an ideal fit alongside Wade and James in Miamiâ€™s last four years. Â He fell victim to punching bag status on a number of occasions, however that has ultimately motivated him over the past few seasons to become a bit more well-rounded. His post-season from hell was a small sample size, albeit a crucial stretch, of a mostly solid career.</p>

<p>Chris Andersen has beenÂ Miamiâ€™s lone true center the last two years, which is a big reason Miami has struggled inside the paint. Birdman did much of the dirty work for the Heat and will continue to do so. Â Andersen averaged less than 20Â minutes per game the last two seasons but he makes his defensive presence and athleticism in the paintÂ well-known.</p>

<p>Haslem, along with Wade, has been one of the franchiseâ€™s most loyal and dependable players on and off the court overÂ the last decade. Â Born in Miami, U.D. seemed destined to spend a respectable career in front of his fans in the American Airlines Arena. Â Haslem has not been known as a special player, but he does what is asked of him â€” sets picks, plays physical inside, and spaces the court very well.</p>

<p>On top of that, Miami added a once prolific scorer in Danny Granger, who hopes to get his career back on track in Miami. Â The 31-year-old is a formerÂ NBA All-Star. Â Ever since he hit a wall of recurring injuries in 2012, Granger has not been the same player. He wasÂ a versatile stretch forward who could play both positions. It is highly unlikely Granger will rise back up to a star-like status but of nearly 26 points per game and 40 percent three-point shooting. However,Â Miami needs him to regain his health, composure, and confidence while showing flashes of the old Granger.</p>

<p>The Heat also agreed to terms with sharp-shooting big man Josh McRoberts. This was the one big signing that was supposed to benefit James the most. Â But so be it; James is gone and Erik Spoelstra will likely utilize a hard-nosed McRoberts as the starting power forward. Â McBob is a very solid role player who responds to his assignments. Â He is very aggressive on the boards and his pure lefty stroke forces tall defenders away from the basket.</p>

<p>James was obviously the leader of the team and the organization desired his exemplary leadership. Â After making the NBA Finals four straight years, Riley and Heat management did not exactly anticipate such a sudden departure from James. Â The King himself spoke highly of the success he had in Miami directly after being defeated by the Spurs in the 2014 Finals.</p>

<p>â€œWe have made the Finals every year (since I have arrived in Miami) and won twice,â€ James said.Â  â€œ50 percent; Iâ€™ll take that all day.â€</p>

<p>That statement alone may have led Miami fans to have a strong belief the King would stick around South Beach at least another year or two. But James is a unique person because the media is never really able to extract the full truth in terms of his beliefs.</p>

<p>It was widely assumed that Chris Bosh would move onto Houston if James decided to leave Miami.Â  However, LeBronâ€™s departure actually gave Miami more flexibility to keep Bosh, and James staying in Miami was never exactly a sure thing with three All-Star caliber players expressing their desire to earn as much money as possible.</p>

<p>Because of Miamiâ€™s quick turnaround locking in Bosh and Wade, and surrounding them with several veteran pieces, there is still plenty of life in Miami.Â  Winning is part of Pat Rileyâ€™s nature; he wants to keep up his winning ways in South Beach. In a wide-open East, Miami remains largely in the playoff picture.</p>
