I"ó<p>Whether you loved or hated <em>The Simple Life</em> back in 2003, itâ€™s no surprise to see Nicole Richie on reality TV again with her new show <em>Candidly Nicole</em>. Itâ€™s nice to see her with a purple hair, donâ€™t care attitude because sheâ€™s clearly a strong independent woman who donâ€™t need no hotel chain heiress. Perhaps some fellow celebrities from the 2000s would like to crawl out from under last decadeâ€™s rock and grace us with their presence. You can thank me later Vh1.</p>
