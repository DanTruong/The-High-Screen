I"}<p>Ahh that’s better. A bit of redemption for my slow start with regard to early season picks. After struggling to a 15-17 record through the first two weeks, my 12-4 record for week three puts me up over the .500 mark for the season with a record of 27-21. With the league playing out the way I largely suspected last week, I’ll try and duplicate my success in week four.</p>
