I"ä<p>Former University of Arizona standout and eight-year NBA veteran Channing Frye is in a good place. He <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/07/07/channing-frye-signs-contract-orlando-magic-phoenix-suns/12318893/">signed a four-year, $32 million contract</a> to switch from one up-start team in Phoenix to another in Orlando. The definition of a stretch forward, the 6-11 Frye has averaged at least 2.0 3PM on 37 percent shooting in three of his last four seasons.</p>

<p>The No. 8 overall selection to the New York Knicks in 2005 is one of the most unique talents in the NBA, a large part of the Suns surprising success a season ago, and someone who Goran Dragic will miss in the pick-and-roll.</p>

<p>For all of his current success, it is important to remember, however, that none of this was guaranteed to Frye after dealing with a scary injury just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Frye began dealing with heart issues in the second half of his third season with the Phoenix Suns in 2012. Â He was forced to refrain from the majority of basketball-related activities the following season when he found out that he had an enlarged heart - something that could jeopardize his career.</p>

<p>As a professional athlete, such news must be so mind-boggling - that something completely out of your control could force you to quit the gameÂ you love. Itâ€™s why the basketball community was so emotional toward Baylor centerÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RAmHBWVVQo">Isaiah Austinâ€™s call of honor</a>Â in the 2014 NBA Draft. Â Austinâ€™s illness, which forced him to forgo his NBA career, carries an emotional magnitude.</p>

<p>Thankfully for Frye, his playing career has just begun. A heart issue is certainly nothing to mess around with, but he made the comeback last season and the 31-year-old big man played an essential part in Phoenixâ€™s shocking success this past season.</p>

<p>In his four seasons with Phoenix, Frye shot just about 39 percent from downtown. Â After returning to Arizona after playing in New York and Portland,Â Frye was immediately welcomed back home by a well-respected Suns organization. Â Frye was happy to be playing with a Hall-of-Fame point guard in Steve Nash - both to learn from an elite, experienced player and to work in such a high-paced, pick-and-roll centric offense.</p>

<p>Now, five years since Phoenix invested so much in him, younger players such as Victor Oladipo and Aaron Gordon will look up to the veteran as a valuable locker room presence. On top of being a key mentor on and off the court, Frye will provide Orlando with a much-needed knockdown shooter. The Magic have built a nice core of top-notch athletes in Oladipo, Gordon, and Tobias Harris. Â Outside shooting was an issue that clearly needed to be addressed this offseason; Orlando took care of that problem by inking both Frye and Ben Gordon to generous deals.</p>

<p>Finding your niche on the court and in the locker room is an important factor in becoming a successful NBA player. Â Frye has always been known asÂ a great teammate as well as a very easygoing individual. Â Thus, his high character profile has certainly helped him navigate his way through his up-and-down career.</p>

<p>Fryeâ€™s signing with Orlando obviously wonâ€™t carry the weight of other relevant free agents such asÂ LeBron James or Carmelo Anthony. However, Frye can take a team to the next level because of his ability to step out and torch opponents with his three-point shooting. Â That, specifically, is a game-changer on a regular basis as it takes away sizable defenders from the hoop and forces them to stay out on Frye.</p>

<p>The Orlando Magic are not in â€œwin-nowâ€ mode. Â However, the Magic will likely take a step up from a year ago - just the nature of the weak the Eastern Conference. Â Although they arenâ€™t expected by any means to be a playoff team, sneaking into the No. 8 spot would not be a shocker. Â Well-respected veterans like Channing Frye will be a key ingredient in the progress of the youthful Orlando Magic.</p>
