<p>Following episode sixâ€™s shocking ending, Peggy Carter, now under the custody of the S.S.R., seems to be out of options. Leviathan is closing in from all sides. Dottie Underwood, a Leviathan sleeper super spy has exposed herself to Peggy and is thirsty for blood. Dr. Ivchenko is revealed to have mastered hypnotizing men during World War II as a desperate response to a shortage in anesthetics.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of â€œSnafuâ€ is the S.S.Râ€™s interrogation of Agent Carter. Weâ€™ve seen the varying tactics of Dooley, Sousa and Thompson used on suspects in the past but never anything like this. Peggy is put through the carousel of strategies from the three men. They appeal to her heart, accuse her of being Howard Starkâ€™s lover and unknowingly bring up Peggyâ€™s ultimate Achilles heel, Steve Rodgers.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s telling that after Peggy attempts to exonerate Howard Stark, each of the men accuse of her of being â€œjust another Stark girl.â€ Sexism has been rampant in Agent Carter, and to this point Peggy has used it to benefit her, but this situation required Peggy to do something altogether different. Pushed to the end of her wits, Peggy lays it all on the agents and Chief Dooley. She chastisesÂ them for a seasonâ€™s worth of ignorance. (Oh, how rewarding that moment was.)</p>

<p>The episode continues to plot on after this emotional explosion. Ivchenko, still a simple psychiatrist to Chief Dooley, manages to hypnotize Dooley. While weâ€™re given another example of how dangerous Ivchenko is, Jarvis arrives with a bombshell. After artfully getting past the â€œphone companyâ€ workers used to disguise the S.S.R. headquarters, Jarvis brings a signed confession from Howard Stark that also frees Peggy of all guilt. Curveball? Once alone with Peggy, Jarvis reveals (or is forced to reveal), that the confession is only a ploy of Jarvis.Â By chance, Peggy notices Ivchenko using Morse code to communicate with Dottie acorss the streetÂ and decides to lay all her cards on the table. She tells the S.S.R. everything â€” Howardâ€™s plea for help, her personal investigations into Leviathan and that the orb she stole from the S.S.R. contains Captain Americaâ€™s blood. With these admissions as her strongest evidence, Dooley, Thompson and Sousa begin to believe Carter â€” and that something more significant is at play.</p>

<p>Ivchenko, who has finally been given enough time with Dooley, manages to get the chief to give him an unknown Stark invention.Â To confirm Peggyâ€™s accusations, Sousa and Thompson are dispatched across the street to find Dottie, with whom Sousa faces off and barely survives. After confirming Leviathanâ€™s presence, the S.S.R. must refocus but Chief Dooley appears wearing a vest that is bound for explosion. After expressing his last wishes, Dooley sacrifices himself to save the rest of the S.S.R. The most disturbing revelation of the episode comes when the invention is revealed to be a gas which makes all those who smell it turn manic and murderous. The contents of it are tested on a movie theater by Ivchenko and Dottie.</p>

<p>The finale, â€œValediction,â€ picks up from the massacre at the movie theater and immediately addresses it. As casually as weâ€™d expect Howard Stark enters the S.S.R. with information on the gas and the mysterious Batlle of Finow. The gas is called â€œMidnight Oil.â€ It was created to allow soldiers to stay awake days at a time but itâ€™s side-affects were well, murder. It was used at the Battle of Finow by General McGinnis against Howardâ€™s will. Within the files of the battle we find the two Levithan agents from earlier in the season and Johan Fenhoff, or as we know him Dr. Ivchenko.</p>

<p>Knowing that he is who Fenhoff/Ivchenko is after, Howard implores the S.S.R. to set a trap with him as the bait. Clearly one step ahead, Howard is captured by Ivchenko and, you guessed it, hypnotized.Â In a moment that truly displays the complexity of Howard Stark and Dominic Cooperâ€™s understanding of the character, weâ€™re brought to wreckage of Captainâ€™s Americaâ€™s last flight. Convinced heâ€™s finding Captain America, Howard flies toward New York City with the rest of the Midnight Oil that Ivchenko plans to unleash on the city.</p>

<p>Peggy, Jarvis and Agents Sousa and Thompson arrive at Howardâ€™s hanger on edge and soon realize the scope of Ivchenkoâ€™s plans. Jarvis volunteers to take down Howardâ€™s plane if need be and the Agents move to neutralize Leviathan. Peggy finally faces off with Dottie who proves to be her biggest adversary yet but the fight was missing substance. Dottie spoke of jealousy for Peggyâ€™s life but their relationship wasnâ€™t even developed enough for this to really hit deep. Dottie is eventually thrown from a window by Peggy and she gets to work trying to bring Howard back to reality.</p>

<p>Agent Thompson and Agent Sousa set out to find Ivchenko and Thompson for all his brawn is immediately knocked out by the doctor. When Sousa finds Ivchenko the situation does not improve. Ivchenko needs only to say the word â€œfocusâ€ and begins to hypnotize Sousa and attempts to make him murder Thompson. Thankfully, Sousa did something that Thompson would have never thought of, he brought ear plugs.</p>

<p>Peggy all the while is faced with the ultimate task, talk Howard down or order him to be shot down. Baring it all, Peggy tells HowardÂ and through extension herself, that they both have to let Captain America go. Through Peggyâ€™s heartfelt plea Howard finally snaps out of his mind control and New York is saved.</p>

<p>In almostÂ tragic timing, immediately after Agent Carter reserves a much deserved ovation from the S.S.R., a congressmen shows up and immediately gives Agent Thompson the credit which he does not deny. While Sousa may have been frustrated Peggy tells him what we already knew, she doesnâ€™t need the credit or the accolades, sheâ€™s confident enough without them.</p>

<p>With no guarantees of a second season, the end gives hope for another but also satisfies the journey Peggy Carter has traveled. As she poured Captain Americaâ€™s blood into the river it was honestly believable she could move on with her life. But what would Marvel be without a cameo? Ivchenko, outfitted with headgear to keep him silent, is escorted to prison and his cell-mate takes immediate notice. The infamous Dr. Armin Zola (<a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/25/captain-america-writers-surprise-agent-carter-cameo">played by Toby Jones</a>) is revealed to be his cell-mate and he wastes no time befriending Ivchenko and offering him a pen and paper. This is clearly a response to the seeds sown in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and even in Marvelâ€™s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra lives on and Leviathan is now a major part of that.</p>

<p>Marvelâ€™s Agent Carter at first seemed like ploy for ratings and bridge between Marvel movies but in the end youâ€™d be hard-pressed to call it that. The attention given to Agent Carter was serious and the result was a fun, intriguing and enlightening program.</p>
