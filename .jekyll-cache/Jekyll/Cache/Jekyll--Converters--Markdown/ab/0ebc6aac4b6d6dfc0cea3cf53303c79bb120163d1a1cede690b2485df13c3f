I"<p>To the casual superhero fan, it has been confusing why the Marvel movies have been operating in separate universes. To quickly summarize, until last week Disney owned the rights to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (The Avengers, Agents of Shield, and Guardians of the Galaxy); Sony owned the rights to Spider-Man; and Fox owned the rights to the X-men and Fantastic Four. But now we are living in a completely new world; <a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/news/details-spider-man-appear-in-sony-and-marvel-movies-1201429039/">Marvel and Sony have officially come together</a> to bring Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
