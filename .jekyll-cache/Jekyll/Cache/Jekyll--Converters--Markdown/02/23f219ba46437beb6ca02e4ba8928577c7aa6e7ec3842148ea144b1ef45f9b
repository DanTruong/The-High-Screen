I"û<p>Congratulations are in order for the Houston Texans. Not a lot has gone right for the franchise in the past 12 months, but if nothing else, they made the right move in making J.J. Watt the highest-paid defensive player in league history. According to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11451373/jj-watt-houston-texans-reach-agreement-6-year-100-million-deal">ESPNâ€™s Chris Mortensen</a>, Watt, whose old deal carried him through the 2015 season, will now earn $100 million through the 2021 season, with $51.8 million of that contract being guaranteed. That figure is much more important than the yearly salary of just under $17 million, as it is not uncommon for teams and players to restructure deals later in their careers to free up cap space.</p>
