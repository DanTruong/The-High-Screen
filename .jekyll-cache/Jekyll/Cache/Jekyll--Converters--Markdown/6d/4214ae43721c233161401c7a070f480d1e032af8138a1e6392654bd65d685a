I"!<p>Just as Everett Golson’s heave on fourth and 18 sailed out of the end zone and into the arms of a Florida State defender, something about this college football season suddenly became obvious to me: there isn’t a “best” team this year. There are several really good football teams, but there isn’t a favorite. The three major undefeated teams – Mississippi State, Ole Miss, and Florida State – are all vulnerable. Behind those undefeated teams are a plethora of one-loss teams, and there’s minimal separation between them.</p>
