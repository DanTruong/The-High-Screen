I"ù<p>Technically, Aaron Rodgers has a winning record against the Seattle Seahawks. That is if you count the one snap the then-rookie took against the would-be NFC Champs in 2005. The trend continued in Rodgersâ€™ next game against Seattle (his first as a starter) in 2008 when the Pack skated to a 27-17 victory. Things got even better in 2009 when Rodgers, despite only completing 12 of 23 passes, was a part of a lopsided 48-10 win, in the only home game heâ€™s started against Seattle in his career.</p>
