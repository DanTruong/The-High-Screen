I"¶<p>I started watching Buffalo Bills football in 1999.</p>

<p>I was six and the Bills went 11-5 that year. Then, they played the Tennessee Titans in the playoffs and â€“ ya know what? Letâ€™s not talk about that.</p>

<p>The Bills have not made the playoffs since then. The following years have produced a chain of consistent slightly-below-mediocre play that would make the writers of â€œHow I Met Your Motherâ€ weep with jealous rage.</p>

<p>In that time, the Bills have won six games five different times, seven games three times and eight games twice. Despite missing the playoffs 14 years in a row, the Bills have fallen in the Top 5 of the NFL draft just twice in that span. They nabbed Mike Williams (not the one who always gets arrested) and Marcell Dareus (yes, the one who always gets arrested).</p>

<p>I could go on but the point is made. Itâ€™s been tough.</p>

<p>As if that werenâ€™t enough, the teamâ€™s future in Buffalo was in constant question during that time. From the moment I started watching football through this Tuesday, I was unsure whether the Bills had a future in Buffalo. As time went on, I became convinced they didnâ€™t.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/sports/football/terry-pegula-owner-of-sabres-to-acquire-buffalo-bills.html?_r=0">Terry Pegula changed all that</a>. The team is staying. The burden has been lifted.</p>

<p>So, why does it feel so wrong to celebrate?</p>

<p>If this had all happened ten, five or even two years ago, Iâ€™d feel unrestrained joy. But not now.</p>

<p>Not when I know football is a doomed sport.</p>

But if the NFL loses the public â€” if the people turn on the league, the sport â€” then why will it matter that Buffalo is keeping its team?[/caption]</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Not in the wake of <a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/09/women-inequality-in-nfl-hobby-lobby/">the Ray Rice scandal</a> and <a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/08/a-consistent-failure-roger-goodell-does-not-care-about-janay-palmer/">the Roger Goodell cover-up</a> or however youâ€™d like to refer to it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons why Iâ€™ve grown apart from football in the past year or so.</p>

<p>Not the least among them is the NFL product itself. Frankly, Iâ€™m sick of sitting in front of a TV for three and a half hours to watch 10 minutes of action.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s more than that. From the corrupt pool of owners, to the violent, <a href="http://www.sportsworldnews.com/articles/17699/20140911/aaron-hernandez-murder-case-update-attorneys-for-ex-patriots-tight-end-want-cell-phone-evidence-thrown-out-video.htm">occasionally sociopathic</a> players, itâ€™s becoming more difficult to justify supporting the league. (And thatâ€™s not even including <a href="http://search.espn.go.com/rape/stories/college-football/5-28">college footballâ€™s rape epidemic</a>).</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s not why the NFLâ€™s doomed. Theoretically, this corruption show disguised as a football league could continue on forever. That is, if it wasnâ€™t for the possibility that the human body isnâ€™t meant to play football.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re a sports fan, youâ€™ve probably heard a good amount about this, the so-called â€œconcussionâ€ issue. But it seems many donâ€™t have a good grasp on how serious the issue is and how complicit the NFL was in making sure no one found out about it.</p>

<p>Take this <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2014/08/07/why-you-should-stop-watching-football/FYbCW73jay4MzeMQ6pC5TK/story.html">Boston Globe piece</a>. Among the shocking and saddening facts in this story: recently-retired NFL players are 19 times more likely to develop dementia than the average person; and NFL players can expect to live to about 55 years old.</p>

<p>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. What a terrifying disease. You can survive (and with the right enthusiasm, thrive) without an arm, without a leg, without a finger, without a kidney, etc. You canâ€™t live a quality life with a damaged brain. Itâ€™s not possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, itâ€™s not possible for the NFL to change the rules enough to help any of this. While cutting down on head-shots and actually forcing players to sit during injuries is a step in the right direction, it doesnâ€™t address the root of the problem: <a href="http://www.traumaticbraininjury.net/soccer-and-the-sub-concussive-hits-silently-destroying-the-brain/">sub-concussive hits</a>.</p>

<p>Players constantly colliding is a fundamental reality of football. And a side effect to those collisions is neurological damage. That appears to be a fundamental reality of science.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned Boston Globe piece, Steve Almond made the point that â€œOver the past few years, a growing body of medical research has confirmed that football can cause traumatic injury to the brain, not as a rare and unintended consequence, but as a routine byproduct of how the game is played.â€</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t possibly sum up my feelings better. Youth football is already suffering from a <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/page/popwarner/pop-warner-youth-football-participation-drops-nfl-concussion-crisis-seen-causal-factor">lack of participation</a>. Whether itâ€™s in 25 years, 50, 100 or five, the NFL will eventually cease to exist.</p>

<p>After about two hours of celebratory tweeting, this all came back to me. Donâ€™t get me wrong â€” Iâ€™m excited for Sunday. Iâ€™ll watch. Iâ€™ll cheer. But it wonâ€™t feel like it once did. Every positive NFL-related development is draped by a dozen negative ones.</p>

<p>Pegula has made sure the Bills stay in Buffalo. But for how long will that matter?</p>

<p>For now, by all means, Buffalo: squish the fish.</p>
