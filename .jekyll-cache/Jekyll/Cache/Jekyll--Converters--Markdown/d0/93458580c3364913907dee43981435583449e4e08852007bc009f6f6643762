I"É<p>The Sanchize has come to Philadelphia. The debate that has the Philly media abuzz is the status of NFC East-leading Eagles with Mark Sanchez at the helm for the next six to eight weeks. Anyone whoâ€™s watched football in the last five years is familiar with Sanchezâ€™s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAp57G1hLn0">infamous struggles</a>Â with the Jets, and the incompetent efforts by the New York front office to replace him. Seriously-Mike Vickâ€™s performance against the Steelers yesterday aside-who would have thought that a year and a half after benching Sanchez, fans would think wistfully back to the days of number six with thoughts of â€œthat Sanchez kid was only <em>pretty bad</em>.â€</p>
