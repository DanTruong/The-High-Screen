I":<p>Apparently there was some kind of big football game this weekend. I didn’t catch it because I was too busy watching Quinnipiac and Niagara play a double-overtime thriller, reminiscent of some of the greatest basketball games ever played (what’s hyperbole?). Oh well, I guess a lot of people watched it.</p>
