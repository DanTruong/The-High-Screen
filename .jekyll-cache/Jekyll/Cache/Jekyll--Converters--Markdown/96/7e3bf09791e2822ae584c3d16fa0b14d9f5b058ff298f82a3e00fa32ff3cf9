I"<p>The NBA is correctly labeled as the major professional sports league with the least amount of parity, as there is little variance, year to year, of true-blue championship contenders. In a league where the majority of its teams make the playoffs each season, and 30 teams play 82 games from late-October to mid-April to wiggle into a 16-team, two conference playoff field, only nine different franchises have won the NBA Finals since 1980 — and eleven franchises have failed to make the Finals altogether.</p>
