I"U<p>It was the week from hell for the NFL. One baby step was taken by a franchise that was at the very center of the storm that now has their front office and the league’s highest office in the cross hairs of the nation. The Baltimore Ravens displayed tremendous resolve Thursday night, trouncing arch rival Pittsburgh in a game that was theirs from the start. The win marks an impressive first step by Baltimore’s locker room in their quest to put the Rice distraction behind them and begin the climb up the AFC North ladder. Pittsburgh on the other hand…more on them later in the week.</p>
