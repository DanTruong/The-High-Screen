I"ÿ<p>There were three major top 10 upsets on Saturday, but the biggest loss of the weekend was the injury to Ohio State quarterback J.T. Barrett. The Buckeyes had already lost quarterback Braxton Miller for the season due to an injury, but Barrett had become a Heisman candidate in his place. Barrettâ€™s injury came during a 42-28 win over Michigan. Now without its best player, again, the Buckeyesâ€™ playoff hopes have diminished drastically â€” unless the committee plans on leaving the future out of it.</p>
