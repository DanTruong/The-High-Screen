I"<p>Thereâ€™s a reason this game is being played in Washington. One has to wonder what attendance figures would be like at MetLife on the final home game of Derek Jeterâ€™s storied career. As it is, viewership will probably suffer if history is any indication; the once Yankee Stadium-based Giants share a good portion of the Yankee fan base. Itâ€™s a shame as this game figures to be a good one.</p>
