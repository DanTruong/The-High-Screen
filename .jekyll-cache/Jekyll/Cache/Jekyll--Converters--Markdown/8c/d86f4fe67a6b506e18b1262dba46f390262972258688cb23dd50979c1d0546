I"ò<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> published an article the other day about the <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-complete-basement-tapes-bootlegs-released-november-20140826">comingÂ release of Bob Dylanâ€™s the completeÂ </a><em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-complete-basement-tapes-bootlegs-released-november-20140826">Basement Tapes</a>Â â€”</em>Â and when released the album will stretch across six audioÂ disks. <em>The Basement Tapes</em> have been an icon of Dylan-lore since their inception in Woodstock, NY around 1968. Less conclusive versions of the album have been released in both bootleg and manufactured form; in fact, I am the proud owner of what I believe is the 1975 edition of the album.</p>
