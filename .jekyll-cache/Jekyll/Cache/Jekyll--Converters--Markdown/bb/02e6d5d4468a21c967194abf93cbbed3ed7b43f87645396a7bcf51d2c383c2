<p>Conrad Richer and Joe Mags debut the Mags to Riches podcast by reacting to the 2015 Grammys and the sudden retirement of Jon Stewart. They also discuss the new deal between Sony and Marvel and the future of Spider-Man movies, and what the heck is going on with the Sacramento Kings. (This podcast uses parts of a song called “Break the Ground” by friend of the show Jamie Cunningham. Follow Jamie on Twitter (@JmeCunningham)) Thanks for listening!</p>
