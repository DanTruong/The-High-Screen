I"à<p>2014 was a very controversial year for video games; while we were graced with a collection of memorable games that pushed both next generation technology along with narrative story telling, we were also met with a variety of issues. (<a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/12/return-form-top-10-video-games-2014/">Click here</a> for my Top 10 video games from 2014.) For every game that pushed the medium to new heights there was another release which crashed and burned. Games like <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Dragon Age Inquisition</em> pushed the new technologies with innovative and impressive new game engines, while <em>Driveclub</em> and <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em> were unplayable for weeks after launch.</p>
