<p>Remember that Green Day song â€œWake Me Up When September Ends?â€ I feel this way aboutÂ the month of October.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always opted out of the horrorÂ of Halloween and focused on the fun parts â€” eating candy, wearing pretty outfits that straddle the line of appropriateness. (Thatâ€™s what Halloween is all about, right?)</p>

<p>Scary movies have always been a no-go for me, and yet, in the digital age, I canâ€™t escape them. It used to be simple as turning the TV off whenever a creepy preview came on but those days are long gone. Iâ€™ll be scrolling through Tumblr, one minute thereâ€™s a nice steady feed of puppy pictures and BAM someone had to post an entire .gif setâ€™s worth of the most terrifying shit ever. Just trying to watch a nice YouTube video of hamsters eating burritos, canâ€™t get to the cuteness until Iâ€™m forced against my will to sit through a horror movie preview.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t shut myself off from the world until I have to get dolled up in some half assed sexy cat costume just so I can possibly get free drinks at a bar. Iâ€™m a grown ass woman who needs to face her fears, and most importantly not violently shut her laptop down whenever a horror movie ad appears. Therefore, Iâ€™ve challenged myself to watch a number of horror movies throughout the month of October.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve never seen a horror movie and I have successfully sat through a few of them. Iâ€™ve seen a small fraction of whatâ€™s out there, but perhaps youâ€™ll be surprised at how many classics and cult favorites I havenâ€™t seen. I have my friends to thank for what Iâ€™ve seen so far, itâ€™s a miracle theyâ€™re not deaf. Â To be honest, Iâ€™m pretty calm during the whole experience. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever cried, an occasional scream is inevitable, and my apologies to any date whoâ€™s had to endure a painful hand squeeze.</p>

<p>Perhaps itâ€™s my neurotic nature but my fear of horror movies is more of a mind game. Iâ€™ll sit there nice and calm, look away a few times, but itâ€™s everything afterwards that gets to me. Iâ€™ll be a total paranoid android and the movie will just stay with me, especially if itâ€™s realistic.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a definitive ranking of things that freak me out. Judge me all you want, if you already havenâ€™t:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vampire.jpg"><img src="/img/vampire.jpg" alt="Vampire bloody lips desire" /></a></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><strong>Monsters</strong> - Iâ€™m not even sure if this counts as a category, thatâ€™s how clueless I am to this entire genre. I donâ€™t know, monsters seem a bit too ridiculous for me. Like I feel disturbed, but theyâ€™re also on the same level of unicorns in terms of existence, so then Iâ€™m all good. Then again, I think aliens get lumped into this category and Iâ€™m not going to completely rule them out.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/zombies.jpg"><img src="/img/zombies.jpg" alt="Creepy set of bloody zombie hands, studio shot over gray backgro" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Zombies</strong> - Although a zombie apocalypse is possibly one of the most realistic scenarios, I think binge watching every episode of <em>The Walking Dead</em> this past summer just kind of desensitized me toward them. Sign me up for more zombie killing classes please.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/serial-killer.jpg"><img src="/img/serial-killer.jpg" alt="one causasian man serial killer with mask portrait in silhouette" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Serial Killers</strong> - Obviously (and unfortunately) this is a thing that exists in the real world. However, movie serial killers have such a strange range. Like if Freddy Kreuger approached me Iâ€™d scream at first but then ask him where he likes to shop for sweaters. But would I ever call up Hannibal Lector to come meet up at Starbucks for Pumpkin Spiced Lattes? Absolutely not.</p>

<p><strong>Ghosts/demons/etc..</strong> - Basically if you canâ€™t shoot, stab, or call the cops on it, youâ€™re probably fucked. Thatâ€™s how I see it at least. But letâ€™s break this down a bit further: <strong>Possessed children</strong> - noooooope. <strong>Haunted dolls</strong> - more noooooope. <strong>Angry vengeful spirits</strong> - I didnâ€™t even do anything to you, can you not?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve decided to watch a whole range of horror movies covering what Iâ€™m afraid of, and perhaps what I didnâ€™t know I was completely terrified of. Every week, Iâ€™ll watch a couple and then of course give a review based on all of my scaredy cat feels and hopefully some triumphs. Halloween hilarity and terror ensues.</p>
