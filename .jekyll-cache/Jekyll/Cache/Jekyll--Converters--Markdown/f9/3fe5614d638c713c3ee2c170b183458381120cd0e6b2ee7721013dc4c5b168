I"‚<p>A rejuvenatedÂ Kobe Bryant is coming back to play another NBA season. That places a limit on the number of touches Nick Young will have in â€˜14-â€˜15Â compared to last season, which could be a reason Young is having a ball off the court in the meantime. His latest perk involves having rookies Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson address him as <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24716196/lakers-rookies-will-have-to-refer-to-nick-young-as-daddy-swag">â€œDaddy Swagâ€</a> â€” thatâ€™s no misprint, and knowing Nick Young, how could it be?</p>

<p>He sure has taken over the entertainment role for the Los Angeles Lakers. He is sweetening up Hollywood and may be the teamâ€™s best reality TV-product since Shaq-and-Kobe in the early 2000s. Nick is not shy when it comes to the spotlight. That can be backed up by his <a href="http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_wr9lbnje/">expressed desire for female hip-hop star Iggy Azalea</a>.</p>

<p>However, it is unnecessary to only associate Swaggy P with public entertainment in L.A. Â Young has quietly been around a while, going into his eighth year in the league and playing for his fourth team. Â Young spent the first four and a half years of his career in Washington, where he was mostly a scorer off the bench and a complement to Gilbert Arenas. The â€˜10-â€˜11 campaign was one of Youngâ€™s most efficient seasons, as he averaged 17.4 points while shooting a respectable 44 percent from the field.</p>

<p>After spending brief periods of time with the Sixers and the Clippers, Young found his niche with the depressed Laker franchise in 2014. Â Regardless of how strong the teamâ€™s roster was, or wasnâ€™t, Young fit the bill as an uptempo player â€” a scorer who isÂ deadly when on and one-dimensional when off, a credit to his lacking effort on the defensive end. But Bryant and the Lakers seeÂ value in Young, both on and off the court, going forward. JimÂ Buss rewarded Swaggy P with a reasonable <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24616493/nick-young-agrees-to-4-year-215-million-deal-with-lakers">$21.5 million over the next four years</a>.</p>

<p>Nick Young truly has great scoring ability, but heÂ has failed to prove, thus far, he can be the type of playerÂ capable of averaging 25-plus points every night. If Young took 20 shots a game and played 40 minutes, I bet he could average 25. But his consistency is what has heldÂ him back from being among the top scorers in the NBA. As a defender, it is pretty predictable what Young wants to do â€” Daddy SwagÂ wants to get the ball and shoot, and maybe take a few dribbles here and there. When Young gets cold, he goes ice cold and seems to lose some of hisÂ otherwise braggadociousÂ confidence.</p>

<p>For example, last season he averaged 14.6 points on a miserable 35.6 percent shooting against his division. But against the rest of the conference, he averaged 17 points on 44.5 percent shooting. In five games betweenÂ January 7-15, Young put up the following: two points on 1-for-7 shooting; 25 points on 10-for-20 shooting; 11 points on 3-for-14 shooting; 28 points on 7-for-16 shooting; and nine points on 4-for-8 shooting before a minor injury forced him to sit out the remainder of that game. In other words, heâ€™s up then down then up then down again.</p>

<p>All that aside, Young must be more assertive on the defensive end this year. Defense is half of the game, and up until this point in his career, his teamâ€™s have not been able to trust him as a legitimate No. 1 option because they cannot rely on him to defend 35-40 minutes a game. If you arenâ€™t a willing and somewhat hardworking defender, the value you bring to your team diminishes, and itâ€™s not like Young doesnâ€™t haveÂ the athletic ability to be at least a decent defender.</p>

<p>The LakersÂ needYoung to step up his defensive intensity this year. 36-year-old Kobe Bryant is returning from two major injuries, including a torn achilles as well as a fractured knee. Bryant used to be the best perimeter defender on the Lakers â€” this has been <a href="http://www.forumblueandgold.com/2012/12/10/lakers-defensive-problems-include-kobe-bryant/">a declining part of his game</a>, however, for multiple seasons â€” and will still be expected to be adequate at defending his position if only by nature. The Lakers have holes all over their defense â€” Steve Nash is, if not totally done, on his very last legs; Jeremy Lin struggles to guard opposing point guards; Carlos Boozer is Carlos Boozer; and as promising a rookie as Julius Randle is, post defense is seen as hisÂ main weakness.</p>

<p>That leaves Young without any excuses. The best five-man units for Los Angeles include Young at small forward sandwiched between a historically grim collection of NBA defenders. He is going to be tasked with guarding the Kevin Durantâ€™s and Carmelo Anthonyâ€™s of the world for the purple-and-gold â€” something he is physically capable of, sure, but not anything he has ever shown he can do on the court.</p>

<p>Young is an ideal blend of charismatic self-marketing and God-given ability to score the basketball for this flawed and mediocre Lakers team. The organization decided it was in its best interest to finally give Young a permanent home, but how much of that was circumstantial? (How many other NBA-caliber starting wings were knocking on their door this off-season?) The Lakers are in the midst of a civil war between the Clippers for who is the best team in Los Angeles, but even with Bryant back in the starting lineup, the purple-and-gold are completely and utterly behind the red-and-white in talent, coaching and team chemistry. The Clippers were a couple bounces of the ball and a giant public relations nightmare away from a run to the conference finals; the Lakers seem poised for another losing record, as theirÂ roster is a collection of dusty veterans and all-offense, no-defense guards taped together with short-term deals.</p>

<p>And yet, Bryant isnâ€™t going to stand for losing basketball, not after watching a painful 55-loss campaign from the bench. Bryant probably knows this roster canâ€™t win a championship as is, but that wonâ€™t stop him from demanding excellence from his new teammates â€” insisting on playing above expectations and refusing to roll over against the loaded West.</p>

<p>To do that, the Lakers will need Young to showcase his talent in front of the Staples crowd. It was one of the few positives from last season, and can work in â€˜14-â€˜15 if he plays wiser and more consistently than ever before. Whether or not Young accepts this challenge will be a theme for the Lakersâ€™ season, as Swaggy P will play a crucial role in their questionable future.</p>
