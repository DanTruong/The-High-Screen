I"Á<p>The happenings of 2014 were to the internet what the Franz Ferdinand assassination was to World War I. Each event, no matter how seemingly innocuous, set off a chain of tweets, shouts, memes, blog posts and think pieces, inevitably causing a wave of rage that receded as quickly as it advanced. Then, weâ€™d get wiped out by the next issue, with the previous one fading into memory. (Remember when we were all going to die because of Ebola?)</p>
