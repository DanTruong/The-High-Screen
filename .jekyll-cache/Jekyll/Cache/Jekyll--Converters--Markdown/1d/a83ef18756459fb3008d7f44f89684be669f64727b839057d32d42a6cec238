<p>Coming off <em>Hall of Fame</em>, Big Sean did nothing to move from the G.O.O.D. Music on deck circle. It was a lukewarm release that left fans wanting just a little bit more. This was mainly due to the release of <em>Detroit</em>, the highly successful mix-tape that was used as a lead-up to <em>Hall of Fame.Â _What fans loved about _Detroit</em> was its combination of sincerity and charisma. <em>Dark Sky Paradise</em> captures that energy again.</p>

<p>From the first track, â€œDark Sky (Skyscrapers),â€ weâ€™re given an insight into the albumâ€™s thesis: he charcoal black production sets the tone for an introspective look into Big Seanâ€™s life. His father, his relationships and his status are growing to be bigger influences on his life at this juncture â€” instead, of you know, big asses â€” and heâ€™s no longer afraid to share that with listeners. <em>â€œI done had a Roley longer than I had relationships / Iâ€™m embarrassed to say that shit.â€</em> Big Sean approaches Dark Sky Paradise with the candor fans respect and have come to expect.</p>

<p><em>Dark Sky Paradise</em> can be split perfectly into two, six-song acts. The first being the attention grabber. <a href="http://radio.com/2014/09/12/big-sean-signs-roc-nation-four-new-songs-listen/">Singles â€œI Donâ€™t Fuck With Youâ€ and â€œParadiseâ€ were released in early fall of 2014 when Big Sean switched his management to Roc Nation</a> and were considered gems at the time. But their popularity clearly spoke to the power of association â€” Kanye West is the executive producer of <em>Dark Sky Paradise</em>, and IDFWY features another smash hit beat/sample from the Hall of Famer. â€œParadiseâ€ is an extended version which features another word play ridden verse that does not disappoint and â€œI Donâ€™t Fuck With You,â€ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHg_RNa4pEc&amp;t=2m20s">which is assumed to be about Big Seanâ€™s relationship with Naya Rivers</a>,Â enjoyed a long run on the Billboard charts and was a no-brainer as an inclusion.</p>

<p>The third single â€œBlessings,â€ which features Drake, another powerful association, and West, details Big Sean and Drakeâ€™s appreciation of their success and status, a radio success since itâ€™s release.</p>

<p>The rest of the first half is crafted just as well as the singles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3puundZvLNA">â€œAll Your Faultâ€</a> is another classic Big Sean and West collaboration for the annals of G.O.O.D. Music. West undeniably steals the show with his verse, which includes a Walt Disney reference, a Tom Cruise reference and mentions the injustices surrounding the Eric Garner murder. â€œPlay No Games,â€ is aÂ perfectly mellow track that shows off Big Seanâ€™s romantic side put to a sample of new jack R&amp;B group Guy.</p>

<p>The second half of the album switches up, and is Big Sean taking a strong stab at the sincerity that has been missing from much of his previous accomplishments. â€œWin Some Lose Someâ€ is one of the most raw looks at himself that Big Sean has released to date. The chorus features uncredited vocals from Jhene Aiko (credited on the album elsewhere) and the songâ€™s outro is handled by <a href="http://youtu.be/Z1ssp8qSVNU?t=8m43s">Big Seanâ€™s father, who is caught in a candid conversation</a> and tells Big Sean what his fans already knew, â€œThatâ€™s why people love you Sean, because you talk to them from your heart.â€</p>

<p>â€œStay Downâ€ is Big Seanâ€™s obligatory crew cut. The song doesnâ€™t stand out among others but it does continue one of the major themes of the album, his roots and his origins. Featuring a pretty slick use of wordplay, this track is for exactly what heâ€™s rapping about, those who stay down through hard times. â€œI Knowâ€ is where we find the aforementioned Aiko collaboration; this track is an interesting take on a hard relationship told from the views of both parties with Sean and Aiko playing the roles.</p>

<p>â€œDeepâ€ brings Lil Wayne back for a second album collaboration in a row, and itâ€™s a standout. Big Sean addresses his concerns with being underrated and these sentiments are bolstered by Lil Wayne. <em>â€œI feel like Sean donâ€™t get enough Shine/ Is it because he ainâ€™t got the tattoos? He ainâ€™t throwinâ€™ up signs.â€</em> (Take that hip-hop neophytes with yourÂ incredulous Lil Wayne sucks arguments). Big Sean is respected and appreciated and with a closer look, heâ€™s certainly underrated. Perhaps itâ€™s the combination of his clean image and his positive attitude. Could a mainstream artist that was responsible for elevating Flo-Rida to prominence have questionable judge of character?</p>

<p>â€œOne Man Can Change the Worldâ€ is Big Seanâ€™s heartfelt dedication to <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6415136/big-sean-grandma-dies">his grandmother who passed away in late 2014</a>. The song features West and John Legend, who both take turns performing the chorus. The features are a perfect touch on a song like this. Sean, Legend and West â€” three long-tenured G.O.O.D. Music artists â€” allÂ add their personal flair to the chorus. The song is the full package, perfect minimal production and features that only add to the honesty of the work.</p>

<p>_Dark Sky ParadiseÂ _isnâ€™t Big Seanâ€™s masterpiece, and at 12 tracks and roughly 50 minutes itâ€™s on the shorter end (but thatâ€™s to be expected when Kanye West is your executive producer). The deluxe version features three new songs including features from PARTNEXTDOOR and Bigâ€™s boo Ariana Grande. The songs arenâ€™t mind blowing but as a whole theyâ€™re worth a listen.Â Big Sean shouldÂ count this as another successful release and another step forward in the right direction. Heâ€™s raised the bar with each album so far andÂ as a G.O.O.D. Music artist, he continues to build and utilize his unlimited number of resources.</p>
