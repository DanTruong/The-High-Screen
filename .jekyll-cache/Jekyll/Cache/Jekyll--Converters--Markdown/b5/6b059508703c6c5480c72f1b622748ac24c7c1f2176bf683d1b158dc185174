I"G<p>The narrative is right there if you want it bad enough. Go ahead, say it.

Enlighten me, oh, Round Mound, on why the Clippers are a real basketball team — <em>“they are tuuuurifcally talented,”</em> <a href="http://www.nba.com/video/channels/tnt_overtime/2015/02/11/20150210-inside-chuck-analytics.nba/">Chuck might say</a> — and how the Rockets are playing some divergent spectacle of the sport you excelled at decades ago.</p>
