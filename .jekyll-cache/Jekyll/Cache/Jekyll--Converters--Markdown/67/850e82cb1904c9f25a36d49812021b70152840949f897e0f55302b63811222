Exciting, young teams could go from afterthought to division winner within a year without breaking the bank.Â  â€œAny team can win the World Seriesâ€ had become less of an empty clichÃ© and more of a reality. If a team is balanced, hits on its draft picks and grabs the right bargain free agents, it has just as much a chance to win the World Series as the big spenders, if not more of one.</p>
