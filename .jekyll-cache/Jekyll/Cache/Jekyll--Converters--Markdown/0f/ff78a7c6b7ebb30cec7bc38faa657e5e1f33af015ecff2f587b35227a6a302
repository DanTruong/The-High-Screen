I"z<p>From the confines of my office Thursday night, I received two notifications from the NBA Game Time app (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vr-VrQLzao">have you pledged appllegiance?</a>) that 14 players had been selected as reserves in the 2015 NBA All-Star game. We’re supposed to scream and shout about which players were snubbed every year, for tradition’s sake, but I mostly agree with the seven chosen reserves in both conferences. More or less, the final 12-man rosters work fine, and specifically the West, which simply has more All-Star worthy players than spots, is as star-studded as we knew it would be.</p>
