I"ÿ<p><em>Note: This piece was written before <a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/2014/12/04/jim-mcelwain-florida-gators-coach/">Florida hired Jim McElwain</a> and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/12/4/7334131/mike-riley-nebraska-football-coach">Nebraska hired Mike Riley</a> this week. We decided that since both schools made bad hires, weâ€™d press on, and hopefully save Michigan from the embarassment that Florida and Nebraska will be suffering for the next three years or less.</em></p>
