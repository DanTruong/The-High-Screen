I"©<p>It finally happened. I finally got a pick right; truly and accurately, right down to the exact score. If you donâ€™t recall, <a href="http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/10/week-5-picks-and-predictions/">last Sunday I predicted the Seahawks would beat Washington 27-17 on Monday Night Football</a>. Not to worry, Iâ€™m not Nostradamus. I <em>onlyÂ _predicted 11/15 picks correctly this week. IÂ _onlyÂ _have a record of 46-31, good for a measly winning percentage of .597, which is _only</em> more wins than 23 of the NFLâ€™s current head coaches.Â  I even <em>inexcusably</em> thought the Giants Falcons game would end 31-21 when in reality, it was a 30-20 finish. Silly me.</p>
