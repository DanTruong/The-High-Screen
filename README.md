# The High Screen

### The hub of sports, pop culture and social trends (formerly)

## Intro

The High Screen started off as a project between myself, Joe Mags (@[thatjoemags](https://twitter.com/thatjoemags)) and Moraima Capell√°n Pichardo ([@Moraima\_CP](https://twitter.com/Moraima_CP)). It was a sports, entertainment and  blog much reminiscent of the former [Grantland](https://grantland.com/) blog. Being freshly graduated from SUNY Oswego at the time, we created this blog initially using Wordpress and shared PHP hosting. Today, this blog stands as an archive for all of the quality work that our writers put in from 2014 to 2015. We hope you enjoy!

## Tech Implementation

This blog was initially hosted on a Wordpress shared site. However, rising costs of hosting and inactivity have made upkeep and maintenance quite difficult. As such, this site was migrated to a Jekyll back-end. The front-end uses the [Clean Blog Theme (customized for Jekyll)](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog-jekyll) developed by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).
