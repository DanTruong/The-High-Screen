The High Screen is a Sports and Entertainment blog that was active from 2014-2015. We've covered stories from the informative to the irreverent, seeking to engage readers while entertaining them at the same time. Formed by former [Oswegonian](https://www.oswegonian.com/) staffers and SUNY Oswego alumni Joe Mags, Moraima Capellán Pichardo, and Dan Truong, The High Screen was an experiment to continue the high-energy thrills that was gained when writing for The Oswegonian. This site serves as an archive of the stories that were written by many of our high-talented journalists and writers.
