Joe and Taylor Pangman discuss "[I'm Not Ready to Go](http://www.thehighscreen.com/2015/02/...)," "[The Opposite of Loneliness](http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/)" and "[The Brain on 23](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/molly-sprayregen/the-brain-on-23_b_6046888.html)" and what it's like being a young, broke millennial in 2015. (This podcast uses parts of a song called “Break the Ground” by friend of the show Jamie Cunningham.)
