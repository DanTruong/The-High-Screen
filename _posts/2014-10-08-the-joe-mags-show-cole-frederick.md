Today on The Joe Mags Show, Cole Frederick and I talk about how Mississippi is owning the SEC West, how the Big 12 is suddenly wide open, and if whether or not the Pac 12 is still playing Division 1 football, amongst other things. (This podcast uses parts of a song called "Break the Ground" by friend of the show Jamie Cunningham. Follow Jamie on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JmeCunningham).)
