We made a podcast! Staff writer Cole Frederick stops by to discuss the state of College Football after the first month of the season. Check out his [latest column](http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/09/thank-you-for-clemsoning-clemson/) and stay tuned for more pods!

(Intro and outro music is by my very talented friend [Jamie Cunningham](https://twitter.com/JmeCunningham). He's a cool guy.)
