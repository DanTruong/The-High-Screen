Taylor Pangman comes on the show to talk about Gone Girl, American marriage in pop culture and the role of gender in some of David Fincher's best films.

If you missed my take on [Gone Girl](http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/10/on-the-run-gone-girl-a-psychopathic-defense-of-american-marriage/) or Taylor's piece on [Glenn Beck and nihilism](http://www.thehighscreen.com/2014/10/when-we-talk-about-nihilism/), give them a read before throwing on the pod. (This podcast uses parts of a song called "Break the Ground" by friend of the show Jamie Cunningham. Follow Jamie on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JmeCunningham).) Thanks for listening!
